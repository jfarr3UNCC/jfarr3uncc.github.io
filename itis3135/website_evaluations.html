                <li>
                    <h2>Contrast:</h2>
                    <p class="critique">
                        The site has a good amount of contrast, the background is black white white text. They use bright colors to draw the users attention to key elements of the page.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Repitition:</h2>
                    <p class="critique">
                        throughout the entire site they keep it consitant with the black and white theming. Whenever an important graph or line is used they throw in a splash of bright neon colors.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Alignment:</h2>
                    <p class="critique">
                        The site has a simple layout with two coloumns. On one coloumn it has some information about the agency and across from it is a graphic. This keeps it easy and simple to navigate.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Proximity:</h2>
                    <p class="critique">
                        All the information that is related to eachother is in close proximity, generally you will be able to see it all without scrolling to far.

            <p>A website designed to advertise the 1996 movie "Space Jam"</p>

                    <h2>Contrast:</h2>
                    <p class="critique">
                        The site uses a black space image as a background, they use bright colored text for some parts which make it difficult to read.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Repitition:</h2>
                    <p class="critique">
                        The site uses multiple different layout for the pages and different font colors which can confuse the user on what they actually can do on the site.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Alignment:</h2>
                    <p class="critique">
                        The main site has a navigation menu in the form of planets orbiting, this is creative but each site has inconsistant layouts which means you have to dart around the page to find anything.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Proximity:</h2>
                    <p class="critique">
                        Everything is generally close together, though in an inconsitant manner so it cancels out any positives it would get for that. The site has tons of empty space that they could use to eliminate the need for that many other pages.
