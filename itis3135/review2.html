        <h3>Evaluation:</h3>
        <p>Crap Principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: The white background of the site makes the text uncomfortable to read, The orange text on the gray nav bar is also difficult to read at a glance and distance</li>
            <li>Repitition: The site does this well, everything is in the same spot on all pages.</li>
            <li>Alignment: The alignment for the most part is good, I think having some of the content to be justified in the center might help make it more appealing, but overal not a big issue</li>
            <li>Proximity: Everything is spaced out well and notihing is so close or far away from eachother</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Requirements</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Header: The page has a header and nav bar</li>
            <li>Main: The main content on each page is present, though the title of each page is in the</li>
            <li>Footer: The page has a footer with all relevant info</li>
        </ul>
    </main>
