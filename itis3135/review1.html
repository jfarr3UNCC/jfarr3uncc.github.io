        <h3>Evaluation:</h3>
        <p>Crap Principles:</p>
        <ul>
            
            <li>Contrast: The background color is a nice dark red which matches the food and theme of the site, but the white text is a little hard on the eyes, nothing that ruins the overall vibe of the site. </li>
            <li>Repitition: The site does this well, everything is in the same spot on all pages.</li>
            <li>Alignment: The alignment for the most part is good, but the titles not being in the middle are odd and can make it hard to tell what page you are on right away</li>
            <li>Proximity: Everything is spaced out well and notihing is so close or far away from eachother</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Requirements</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Header: The page has a header and nav bar</li>
            <li>Main: The main content on each page is present, though the title of each page is in the</li>
            <li>Footer: The page has a footer with all relevant info</li>
        </ul>
    </main>
