            <h3>Personal Background:</h3>
            <p>I was born and live about an hour away from Charlotte, I have been interested in computers and technology since I was a kid and have been involved in things like robotics club throughout my early school years.</p>
            <h3>Professional Background:</h3>
            <p> I have worked as a pest control technician and lawn care technician for the past 3 summers while not in school.</p>
            <h3>Academic Background:</h3>
            <p>This is my third and final year at UNCC, I am majoring in Computer Science and expect to graduate in may.</p>
            <h3>Primary Computer Platform:</h3>
            <p>I mostly use Windows 10/11 for my personal computer for work and games, I sometimes use linux but not as much as windows. I have used macOS in the past but find it limiting and I personally don't like the platform.</p>
            <h3>Courses Im Taking:  </h3>
            <ul class="courses">
                <li>ITIS 4390 - Design Studio: Required capstone course suggested by my advisor</li>
                <li>ITIS 3135 - Web App Design and Development: Sounded like fun and interesting course</li>
                <li>ITCS 3166 - Introduction to Computer Networking: Seemed very useful and interesting</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Funny/interesting Item to Remember Me by:</h3>
            <p>I used to have very long and curly hair but  recently cut it short, throughout the semester I expect it to grow back to where it once was as I usually don't get haircuts during the school year out of laziness.</p>
